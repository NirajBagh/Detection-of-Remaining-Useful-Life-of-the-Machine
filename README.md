# Detection-of-Remaining-Useful-Life-of-the-Machine
This notebook is intended to illustrate conditioning monitoring of industrial machinery by walking through a real life dataset of bearing vibration data.Generally, conditioning monitoring of a machine is done by looking at a sensor mesurement (Eg. Temperature, Vibration ) and imposing bounds to it, i.e. under normal operating conditions, the measurement values are bounded by a maximum and minimum value (similar to control charts). Any deviation is the defined bounds sends an alarm. This is often generally defined as anamoly detection. However, this method often sends false alarms (false positives) or misses an alarm (false negative). Furthermore, a single signal is observed/analysed in isolation. For example, an alarm may sound if the temperature exceeeds a certain level. A system defined above often cannot look at mutiple parameters and come to a conclusion about the state of a machine. Or technical parlance, one cannot take advantage of the multi-dimensionality of the data.
This is where machine learning and other AI based techniques step in.
This notes walks one through anamoly detection of a single dimension data (vibration). This is easier to visualise. The same principles hold true for mutildimensional data as well.
